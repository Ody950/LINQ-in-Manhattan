## Descreption

In this console application, I have deserializes the json to the data, and then use LINQ Query statements and LINQ method then prints the requested data to the console.library by the user.

## How it work

In this application, we were able to access the data in the Johnson file, which contains data about the Manhattan boroughs, where we can access it, sort it, and classify it using LINQ Query and LINQ method, where any programmer can now add the LINQ  to get his own results.

## Visual
